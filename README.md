# TestPython
HP test resolution


# First step (E1)

I believe I have resolved the first exercise correctly.

# Second step (E2)

For the second exercise, I have composed all the parts, including the backend with the .h and .cpp files, as well as the part where I collect and use it in python. I have been unable to execute it, as I have not succeeded in doing so. I have also created the "interface" to manage the backend file in the frontend, but I suspect this is where I am going wrong because I am not very familiar with the C API, and it is new to me, although I would like to learn more about it.
